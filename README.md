Right Now! is a simple pure Javascript demo of Lawnchair.js.  It's
probably a terrible example of how to do things, since it only ever
retrieves a single key and saves it on change, but it's not expected
to be more than that.

I use this as my "new tab" page on Chrame and Firefox, and it's meant
to be a reminder of what *really* needs doing every day.  Since that's 
the page I see most often, this is a very effective high-level to-do
list that I enjoy seeing and using.

RightNow! uses the browser's localstore; all of your updates to your
project list are kept in your browser, and there is no server.
RightNow! is intended to be downloaded and kept on your filesystem,
and you can then set it to be your "new tab" and "home page" pages, so
that every time you succumb to the impulse to surf the Internet, your
first view will be a list of the things you really ought to be doing.

If you just want to *use* RightNow!, download the ZIP file (see
"Downloads" in the upper right hand corner) and copy the file
"index.html" from the directory "one-page" to your filesystem, and set
that page as your home page.  For most modern browsers, that one page
contains everything you need: embedded images, in-line styles, and
included interactivity.
