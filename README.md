Right Now! is a simple pure Javascript demo of Lawnchair.js.  It's
probably a terrible example of how to do things, since it only ever
retrieves a single key and saves it on change, but it's not expected
to be more than that.

I use this as my "new tab" page on Chrame and Firefox, and it's meant
to be a reminder of what *really* needs doing every day.  Since that's 
the page I see most often, this is a very effective high-level to-do
list that I enjoy seeing and using.
